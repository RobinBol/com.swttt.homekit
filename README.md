## Homekit for Homey

Before you run the app on Homey, make sure you created the file `env.json` in the root folder. This file should contain your bearer token like this:

 ```
 {
  "BEARER_TOKEN": "Your bearer token here"
}
```
### Important

When you pair Homey within the Home app it should ask for a code. This is `200-20-200`.
