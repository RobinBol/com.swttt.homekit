## Homekit for Homey
___

Before you run the app on Homey, make sure you created the file `env.json` in the root folder. This file should contain your bearer token like this:

 ```
 {
  "BEARER_TOKEN": "Your bearer token here"
}
```

When you pair Homey within the Home app, make sure you use the code `200-20-200`.
